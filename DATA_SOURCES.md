# Friends of Casco Bay Water Quality Monitoring Data

All FOCB nutrients data was shared with CBEP by Friends of Casco Bay.  Data
was received at various times from 2018 through 2020.

The file 'FOCB DIN All Current Sites.xls' contains little metadata defining
the units used.  An email from Mike Doan of FOCB confirmeds that all DIN 
data are expressedin uM (micromolar).
