# Introduction
This notebook produces graphics summarizing DIN and TN data  from Friends of
Casco Bay samples.

FOCB reports the TN samples and DIN samples were sent to different laboratories,
and so direct comparison relies on consistent calibration, etc. across two labs.
Accordingly, here we restrict our analysis to looking at the two data sources as
complementary views of nitrogen in Casco Bay.

FOCB also reports that some DIN samples over the years had unusually high
ammonium values, and that those samples were noted by the laboratory conducting
the analyses, but not flagged as errors.  We created a reduced data set that
dropped those potentially spurious ammonium (and DIN) values.  See the notebook
"FOCB_Nutrients_Combined.Rmd" for explanation and details.

Note that analysis showed significant site to  site, year to year, and seasonal 
variation in nutrient values (see "FOCB_DIN_Analysis.Rmd" and
"FOCB_TN_Analysis.Rmd" for details). Much of the data preparation here consists
of selecting a subset of available data where differences in sampling history
from site to site and month to month are unlikely to bias results in any
significant way.

## Load Data
The data we use here has had a number of suspiciously high NH4 values removed.
See "FOCB_Nutrients_Combined.Rmd" for details and explanation.

```{r load_data}
strict_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, 
                                 "focb_n_data_strict.csv"))%>%
  mutate(dt = as.Date(dt)) %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
         yearf = factor(year))
```

## Station Names
```{r folder_refs_2}
fn <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites SHORT NAMES.xlsx'
names_df <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn))
```

# Recent Conditions
In our analyses ("FOCB_DIN_Analysis.Rmd" and "FOCB_TN_Analysis.Rmd"), we 
concluded that uneven sampling across sites, years, and  times of year 
strongly influences models fit to "recent" data.  We have fairly complete data 
on  DIN from all FOCB stations from 2019, and for TN from 2018 and 2019.

Our primary goal is to provide a map and accompanying chart of DIN and TN
levels.  For that, we want to compare all **sites** on an even footing.  We now
know that there are important annual and seasonal processes at work, so the
uneven sampling history affects estimates of site conditions.  We worked through
several models to account for those differences, but ultimately concluded that
we are better off simply restricting data to subsets of the available data where 
those effects are minimized.  

We remove the Knightsville Landing Station, which has very limited TN data
and no DIN data.

```{r make_recent}
recent_data <- strict_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014) %>%
  filter(station != 'KVL84') %>%
  select(station, dt, year, yearf, month, doy, tn, nox_N, nh4_N, din_N, organic_N)
```

```{r add_site_names}
recent_data <- recent_data %>%
   mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
   mutate(station = factor(station),
          station_name = factor(station_name)) %>%
   mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, tn, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, tn, median, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
   relocate(station_name, .after = station)
```

## TN Data 2018 and 2019
We restrict the data to May to September, for the years 2018 and 2019 only.
We also filter out negative values  (which are impossible) and very high values
that appear to be inconsistent with the DIN data.

```{r make_18_19}
tn_data_18_19 <- recent_data %>%
  filter(year > 2017) %>%
  filter(month %in% month.abb[5:9]) %>%
  filter(tn > 0, tn < 1.5) %>%
  select(station, station_name, dt, month, doy, tn) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(factor(station), tn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(station_name = fct_reorder(factor(station_name), tn, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Descriptive Statistics
```{r tn_18_19_results}
tn_results_18_19 <- tn_data_18_19 %>%
  mutate(tn = if_else(tn > 1.5 | tn <= 0, NA_real_, tn)) %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(across(tn, c(mn = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                  n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                                  md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE))))) %>%
  mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(factor(station), tn_md),
         station_name = fct_reorder(factor(station_name), tn_md)) %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station)

## DIN Data from 2019
DIN coverage in 2019 is sparse, but consistent across stations. October often 
has higher DIN values than other months, and we have uneven sampling 
across stations, so we drop October data from the analysis, since the uneven 
samples may bias results.

```{r create_2019_data}
din_data_19 <- recent_data %>%
  filter(year == 2019)  %>%
  filter(month %in% month.abb[5:9]) %>%
  filter(! is.na(din_N)) %>%
  select(station, station_name, dt, month, doy, din_N) %>%
  mutate(station = factor(station, levels = levels(tn_data_18_19$station))) %>%
  mutate(station_name = factor(station_name, 
                               levels = levels(tn_data_18_19$station_name)))
```

### Descriptive Statistics
```{r descriptives_2019}
din_results_2019 <- din_data_19 %>%
  group_by(station) %>%

                                  sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                  n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                                  md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE)))))

# Trend Data
Few stations have data from more than a few years.  DIN data has been collected 
over the past couple of years, at several stations in the mid 2000s, and at a
handful of stations pretty much every year since 2001.

## Identify TN Trend Stations
Generally the rule we have used to examine trends is to focus on sites with
relatively complete records, here at least two of the last five years and at
least ten years total.
```{r which_stations}
trend_counts <- strict_data %>%
  group_by(station, year) %>%
  summarize(din_was_sampled =  ! all(is.na(din_N)),
            tn_was_sampled =  ! all(is.na(tn)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(din_last_5 = sum(din_was_sampled & year > 2014),
            din_total = sum(din_was_sampled),
            tn_last_5 = sum(tn_was_sampled & year > 2014),
            tn_total = sum(tn_was_sampled),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter((din_total >= 10 & din_last_5 >= 2) | 
           (tn_total >= 10 & tn_last_5 >= 2))

trend_sites <- trend_counts %>%
  filter(tn_total > 10) %>%
  pull(station)
trend_sites
rm(trend_counts)
```

## Generate Trend Data
```{r make_trend_data_prelim}
trend_data <- strict_data %>%
  filter(station %in% trend_sites) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(din_N) & is.na(tn))) %>%
  mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
  mutate(station = factor(station),
         station_name = factor(station_name)) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, tn, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, tn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  select(- din_depth, -tn_depth, -c(nox:din))
```

## Restrict Data to Summer Months
Analysis showed that sampling at different times of year biased results, with 
nitrogen levels generally higher in cold season.  Since FOCB did not sample
at consistent times of year across all years, different sampling histories
can generate the spurious appearance of long term trends.

To avoid that problem, we restrict attention to just the "warm" months from
May through October, when FOCB is currently collecting data on a consistent 
basis.

```{r restrict_to_summer}
trend_data <- trend_data %>%
  filter(month %in% month.abb[5:10])
```

# TN Graphics
## Create TN Trend Data
We remove a nominal zero value and two anomalous high values, drop unnecessary
data, and drop all samples where no TN data is available.
```{r create_tn_trend_data}
tn_trend <- trend_data %>%
  mutate(tn = if_else(tn <= 0 | tn >= 1.5, NA_real_, tn)) %>%
  select(-nox_N, -nh4_N, -organic_N, -din_N) %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn))

tn_trend_summary  <-   tn_trend %>%
  select(station_name, year, tn) %>%
  group_by(station_name, year) %>%
  summarize(across(tn, 
                   .fns = list(mn = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                               sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                               n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                               md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                               iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                               p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                               gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE)))),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(! is.na(tn_md)) %>%
  mutate(dt = as.Date(paste0('06-15-', year), format = '%m-%d-%Y'))
```

## Showing Estimated Marginal Means
### Linear Model
```{r trend_lm_1}
trnd_lm <- lm(log(tn) ~ station_name + station_name:year + month,
              data = trend_data)
emms_tn <- emmeans(trnd_lm, c('station_name', 'year'), cov.keep = 'year', type = 'response')
```

```{r}
emms_df <- as_tibble(emms_tn) %>%
  mutate(dt  = as.Date(paste0(year, '-06-10')))
```

We remove the predictions for Stations without significant trends.
```{r}
emms_sig_df <-  emms_df %>%
  filter(station_name %in% c('Broad Sound', 'Clapboard Island',  'Fort Gorges'))
```

```{r core_months_plot_by_date_emms_tall, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(tn_trend, aes(dt, tn)) +
  geom_point( color = cbep_colors()[5]) + 
  geom_line(data = emms_sig_df, 
            mapping = aes(x = dt, y = response),
